# simplurl

This is a stupid URL shortener that I wrote to familiarize myself with [Datomic][], and try out literate-ish programming with [Marginalia][].

It doesn't have a UI. I used curl.

## Installation

You need [`lein`][lein].

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jkbsl/simplurl.git
cd simplurl
lein ring server-headless
```

## Usage

Don't use this.

## Docs

You can get some cool HTML docs via `lein marg` or [read them online][docs].
